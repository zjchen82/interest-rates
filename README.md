# Deposit Interest Rates Comparator

This project is for user to compare the fixed deposit and saving deposit rates between financial companies and banks.

[Sprint Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is chosen as the backend to consume the API provided by Monetary 
Authority of Singapore (MAS) which provides monthly interest rates of banks and financial companies. It provides the 
data to front-end so that front-end can focus on the presentation. By separating the data and presentation layer, it 
empowers the backend to focus on the business logic instead of mixing up with front-end logic. It also gives front-end
more flexibility on UI & UX.
